    "This project forms part of the assessment for the Applied Statistics module of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics from ATU. In it, I will analyse the PlantGrowth R Dataset: this dataset consists of \"results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the 30 rows relating to a sample of a plant. Each row contains data for the weight of the sample plant and whether the sample belongs to the control group, the group which has received 'treatment 1' or the group which has received 'treatment 2'; each of these three groups contain 10 samples. Despite searching, I was unable to determine the unit of measurement of the yields in this dataset, but it seems probable to me that the yields are measured in grams; I have labelled my plots below with this unit of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will give an overview of what a **t-test** is, how it works, and what the assumptions are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will carry out a **t-test** on the PlantGrowth R Dataset to determine whether there is a significant difference between the **two** treatment groups trt1 and trt2.\n",

    "Then to investigate whether there is a significant difference between the **three** treatment groups ctrl, trt1, and trt2, I will carry out **ANOVA**.\n"

    "### T-test ###\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Wikipedia, a T-test is 'a statistical test used to test whether the difference between the response of two groups is statistically significant or not'. We can use it to test whether we can reject a null (default) hypothesis that two groups have the same mean values. If we have more than two groups which we would like to compare the means of we must use a multiple comparisons test such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of comparing mean values of populations, the null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of the two populations. Depending on how extreme the outcome of the experiment is, we can either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the value of the t-statistic calculated using the sample data is sufficiently extreme and the probability (p-value) of such a value occurring is less than a chosen level (α or alpha), often 5%, then we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. It should be noted that if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, this does not prove that the null hypothesis is true; rather, that the data do not provide strong enough evidence against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the nature of the data we want to investigate and the aim of our experiment, we can carry out a one sample t-test, a two-sample t-test or a paired t-test:\n",
    "- one sample t-test: Example: testing if the height of a randomly selected group of 100 men from a country differs from the supposed national average.\n",
    "- two sample t-test: also called independent samples t-test. Example: Two different groups of 20 people follow different weight loss diets over the course of 4 weeks and their average weight loss is compared at the end.\n",
    "- paired t-test: also called dependent samples t-test. Example: A group of 20 subjects is asked to sit a maths exam at 9 am before having a coffee, and their average score is measured. The next day, they sit another maths exam, but have a coffee one hour before, and their average score is measured. The difference is average scores are analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assumptions which underpin t-tests include the following:\n",
    "- Data are continuous rather than discrete\n",
    "- Sample data have been randomly sampled from a population\n",
    "- Groups of data being analysed have homogeneous variances (variability is equal within each group)\n",
    "- Data are normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out a t-test, we need to do the following:\n",
    "1. Outline what the null (H0) and alternative hypotheses (Ha) will be for our test.\n",
    "2. Decide what level of significance we will use (α or alpha). \n",
    "3. Check that the assumptions of a t-test are met for the data being tested.\n",
    "4. Choose the correct formulation of the t-test - that is, is it a one-sample test or two-sample test.\n",
    "5. Perform the test and compare the calculated t-statistic to a theoretical value from a t-distribution which takes account of the degrees of freedom of the data. "

    "When comparing the means of more than two groups, it is more appropriate to use ANOVA than multiple t-tests for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a t-test, there is always a chance of a type I error. This is the also known as a false positive, as it refers to when the null hypothesis is rejected despite it being true. The probability of a type I error is equal to the significance level of the test. In the case of one t-test with a signficance level (α) of 5%, you have a 5% of seeing a type 1 error. If you had seven datasets and wanted to compare the means of each dataset to one another, you would have 21 pairwise combinations; if each of these has a 5% chance of producing a type-I error, it becomes likely that you will see at least one type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Carrying out ANOVA is computationally more efficient than carrying out multiple t-tests and can communicate to us whether a significant result is indicated through using one number (F-statistic) rather than multiple t-statistics.\n",
