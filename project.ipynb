    "A T-test is 'a statistical test used to test whether the difference between the response of two groups is statistically significant or not'. We can use it to test whether we can reject a null (default) hypothesis that two groups have the same mean values. If we have more than two groups which we would like to compare the means of we must use a multiple comparisons test such as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of comparing mean values of populations, the null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no difference between the means of the two populations. Depending on how extreme the outcome of the experiment is, we can either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the value of the t-statistic calculated using the sample data is sufficiently extreme and the probability (p-value) of such a value occurring is less than a chosen level (α or alpha), often 5%, then we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise we fail to reject the null hypothesis. It should be noted that if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, this does not prove that the null hypothesis is true; rather, that the data do not provide strong enough evidence against it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the nature of the data we want to investigate and the aim of our experiment, we can carry out a one sample t-test, a two-sample t-test or a paired t-test:\n",
    "- one sample t-test: Example: testing if the height of a randomly selected group of 100 men from a country differs from the supposed national average.\n",
    "- two sample t-test: also called independent samples t-test. Example: Two different groups of 20 people follow different weight loss diets over the course of 4 weeks and their average weight loss is compared at the end.\n",
    "- paired t-test: also called dependent samples t-test. Example: A group of 20 subjects is asked to sit a maths exam at 9 am before having a coffee, and their average score is measured. The next day, they sit another maths exam, but have a coffee one hour before, and their average score is measured. The difference is average scores are analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some assumptions which underpin t-tests include the following:\n",
    "- Data are continuous rather than discrete\n",
    "- Sample data have been randomly sampled from a population\n",
    "- Groups of data being analysed have homogeneous variances (variability is equal within each group)\n",
    "- Data are normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry out a t-test, we need to do the following:\n",
    "1. Outline what the null (H0) and alternative hypotheses (Ha) will be for our test.\n",
    "2. Decide what level of significance we will use (α or alpha). \n",
    "3. Check that the assumptions of a t-test are met for the data being tested.\n",
    "4. Choose the correct formulation of the t-test - that is, is it a one-sample test or two-sample test.\n",
    "5. Perform the test and compare the calculated t-statistic to a theoretical value from a t-distribution which akes account of the degrees of freedom of the data. "
